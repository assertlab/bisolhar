## [1.2.0] - 2025-11-30

### ✨ Added
- **Process Analysis Module**: New section analyzing Pull Request dynamics with Lead Time and Divergence/Convergence metrics
  - Lead Time calculation: Average time from PR creation to merge, with smart singular/plural display ('hora' vs 'horas')
  - Divergence metric: Average comments per PR, categorized as 'Baixa (Silencioso)', 'Saudável', or 'Alta (Debate Intenso)'
  - Extreme defensive programming: Handles NaN cases, null arrays, and invalid data gracefully
- **Code Churn Analysis**: Added churn rate calculation to metrics cards with API status handling
  - Returns null for 202/empty responses, displays "Calculando pelo GitHub..." in UI
  - Tracks lines added/removed over time for code volatility insights
- **Zombie Branches Detection**: Enhanced maturity analysis with branch zombie identification
  - Always displays badge (green for 0 zombies, red for >0)
  - Identifies stale branches that may indicate poor maintenance practices
- **Merged PRs Counter**: Repository info now includes total merged pull requests
  - Provides insight into project activity and contribution patterns
- **Dynamic Chart Transparency**: Commit charts now show sample size in titles
  - Displays "(Amostra: X commits)" to indicate data scope
  - Helps users understand analysis limitations for small repositories

### 🔧 Changed
- **Tooltip System**: Updated all tooltips with explicit classification criteria
  - Divergence: "< 1: Baixa (Silencioso), 1 a 5: Saudável, > 5: Alta (Debate Intenso)"
  - Work Habits: "Alerta se > 30% de Madrugada ou > 50% no Fim de Semana"
  - Bus Factor: "Risco de Atenção se > 40%, Risco Crítico se > 60%"
  - Health Score: "Nota baseada em 7 itens: Readme, License, Contributing, Description, Code of Conduct, Issue Template e PR Template"
- **API Error Handling**: Improved robustness for GitHub API responses
  - Better null/empty response handling across all modules
- **Data Validation**: Extreme defensive programming in divergence calculation
  - Input validation, safe averaging, NaN protection

### 🐛 Fixed
- **NaN Classification Bug**: Fixed divergence metric incorrectly categorizing NaN as high debate
  - Now properly returns 'Sem dados (0 PRs)' for empty repositories
- **Plural Logic**: Lead Time now correctly displays singular forms ('1 hora' vs '2 horas')
- **Chart Titles**: Dynamic titles now reflect actual commit sample sizes

# 🎉 Release Notes - Bisolhador Dashboard v1.0.0

We're thrilled to announce the launch of **Bisolhador Dashboard v1.0.0**, the first stable release of our GitHub Repository Analysis tool! This milestone marks the culmination of dedicated efforts to create an intuitive, reliable platform for educators and developers to gain valuable insights into software engineering practices.

## 🚀 What's New in v1.0.0

### 🔍 **Busca & Dados** (Fail-Safe, Token)
- **Intelligent Search**: Seamlessly search and analyze GitHub repositories using the simple `owner/repo` format.
- **Robust Fail-Safe Mechanisms**: Built-in error handling ensures the application remains stable even during API failures, rate limits, or connectivity issues.
- **GitHub Token Integration**: Easily configure personal tokens via the settings ⚙️ button to increase request limits from 60 to 5,000 per hour, enabling uninterrupted analysis sessions.

### 📊 **Métricas Visuais** (Gráficos, Stack Tecnológica)
- **Dynamic Charts**: Visualize commit patterns across weekdays with intuitive bar charts that highlight work habits and crunch periods.
- **Technological Stack Visualization**: Explore project language composition through dynamic, color-coded doughnut charts. Known languages feature standardized colors, while unknown languages receive algorithmically generated hues for optimal readability.

### 🔬 **Análise de Processo** (Bus Factor, Crunch, Taxa de Resolução)
- **Contributors Table**: Analyze team composition and distribution through a comprehensive contributors ranking, helping identify Bus Factor risks.
- **Crunch Detection**: Automated analysis of commit timing to detect excessive weekend or late-night work, promoting healthy development practices.
- **Resolution Rate**: Calculate issue resolution efficiency with real-time metrics showing open vs. closed issue ratios, supporting project health assessments.

### 🛡️ **Governança** (Health Score, Maturidade de Engenharia)
- **Community Health Score**: Evaluate repository governance through a scoring system based on 7 critical files (README, License, Contributing Guidelines, etc.), providing a percentage-based health indicator with color-coded feedback.
- **Engineering Maturity Assessment**: Inspect infrastructure quality by checking for Automated Tests, CI/CD pipelines, Linters, and Security Auditing tools, displayed through intuitive badge visualizations.

### 🛠️ **Utilitários** (PDF, Tooltips)
